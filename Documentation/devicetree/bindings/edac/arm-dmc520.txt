* ARM DMC-520 EDAC node

Required properties:
- compatible  : "brcm,dmc-520", "arm,dmc-520".
- reg   : Address range of the DMC-520 registers.
- interrupts  : DMC-520 interrupt numbers. The example below specifies
     two interrupt lines for dram_ecc_errc_int and
     dram_ecc_errd_int.
- arm,interrupt-config : This is an array of interrupt masks. For each of the
     above interrupt line, add one interrupt mask element to
     it. That is, there is a 1:1 mapping from each interrupt
     line to an interrupt mask. An interrupt mask can represent
     multiple interrupts being enabled. Refer to interrupt_control
     register in DMC-520 TRM for interrupt mapping. In the example
     below, the interrupt configuration enables dram_ecc_errc_int
     and dram_ecc_errd_int. And each interrupt is connected to
     a separate interrupt line.

Example:

dmc0: dmc@200000 {
 compatible = "brcm,dmc-520", "arm,dmc-520";
 reg = <0x200000 0x80000>;
 interrupts = <0x0 0x349 0x4>, <0x0 0x34B 0x4>;
 arm,interrupt-config = <0x4>, <0x8>;
};
